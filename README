PEAR channel *information* aggregator

This DOES NOT AGGREGATE PACKGES! It only aggregates information about packages.

At php|tek, I was chatting with MWOP, Ed, and Helgi about adding a `search` command to pyrus. This command
would search some service that aggregates PEAR package information, and would make it easier for people to 
discover PEAR channels and packages.


I hacked this together at php|tek, and this is my response to that discussion.  

There's no admin interface, only CLI scripts to add channels and update channels.

I just used what I knew... so it's a mysql db using the mysqi ext and a stupid active record implementation.

=== Setup! ===

Clone the repo!

There's a Config class in `etc/` with the default configuration in it.
Create a DB that can be connected using `mysqli://pearhunt:pearhunt@localhost/pearhunt`
run `./scripts/upgrade.php` from cli to setup the DB
run `./scripts/addChannel.php pear.php.net` to add a channel to the db

=== Indexing PEAR channels ===

Add a channel and discover all packages:
`./scripts/addChannel.php pear.example.com`

Update a channel:
`./scripts/updateChannel.php pear.example.com`

=== Searching! ===

Right now there's only a json output:

=== TODO ===
When scanning the channels, also scan the packages and index all the classes each package provides...
this would allow us to build a really dangerous autoloader that would install vendor dependencies 
automatically   B-)
