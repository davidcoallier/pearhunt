I hacked this together at php|tek a month or two ago... there's no admin interface, only CLI scripts to add channels and update channels. I just used what I knew... so it's a mysql db using the mysqi ext and a stupid active record implementation.

=== Setup! ===

Clone the repo!

There's a Config class with the default configuration in it.
Create a DB that can be connected using `mysqli://pearhunt:pearhunt@localhost/pearhunt`
run `php upgrade.php` from cli to setup the DB
run `php scripts/addChannel.php pear.php.net` to add a channel to the db

=== Indexing PEAR channels ===

Add a channel and discover all packages:
`php scripts/addChannel.php pear.example.com`


Update a channel:
`php scripts/updateChannel.php pear.example.com`

=== Searching! ===

Right now there's only a json output:
